Learning the warning signs can help you get treatment and help prevent a heart attack or stroke. \\n \\nChest Pain. \\nChest pain is discomfort or pain that you feel along the front of your body, between your neck and upper abdomen. \\nThere are many causes of chest pain that have nothing to do with your heart. \\nBut chest pain is still the most common symptom of poor blood flow to the heart or a heart attack. This type of chest \\npain is called angina. \\nChest pain can occur when the heart is not getting enough blood or oxygen. The amount and type of pain can vary \\nfrom person to person.

The intensity of the pain does not always relate to how severe the problem is. \\nSome people may feel a crushing pain, while others feel only mild discomfort. \\nYour chest may feel heavy or like someone is squeezing your heart. You may also feel a sharp, burning pain in your \\nchest. \\nYou may feel the pain under your breastbone (sternum), or in your neck, arms, stomach, jaw, or upper back. \\nChest pain from angina often occurs with activity or emotion, and goes away with rest or a medicine called \\nnitroglycerin. \\nBad indigestion can also cause chest pain. \\nWomen, older adults, and people with diabetes may have little or no chest pain.
